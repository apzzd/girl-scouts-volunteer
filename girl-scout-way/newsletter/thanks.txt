To all of our supporters, thank you for your nut, candy, and magazine purchases in the fall and cookie purchases in the winter. I really enjoy product sales because I get to meet all of my neighbors and all the money we get goes to fun events. Some of the events we did this past year were:

 - a visit to Misty Mountain Stables
 - tickets for Frosty: A Musical at Barter Theater

We also use the money for: 

 - vests 
 - badges
 - patches
 - workshop materials (like books and art supplies)
 - service project supplies (supplies for planting flowers at North Side Elementary).
