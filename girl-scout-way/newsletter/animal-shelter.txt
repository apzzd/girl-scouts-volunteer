All throughout June, the Girl Scouts of troop 622 collected donations for the Washington County-Johnson City Animal Shelter. The types of things collected were cat litter, dog and cat food, pet beds, blankets, treats, and toys, which were delivered on September 22. Our troop also funded a cat condo, and we have a dedicated plaque inside the shelter.

WCJCAS houses lots of dogs, 300 cats, 7 gerbils, and 2 rabbits. That's a lot of animals to care for! The shelter needs all the help it can get, especially during the pandemic when lots of pets need a temporary home. The assistant director of WCJCAS says, "Thanks for your contribution. The animals need something special as they wait for their next home."
