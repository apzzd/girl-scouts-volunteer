Async-along

Hi Scouts! I have a challenge for you all to get ready for the Girl Scout Way workshop in October. Let's all do an Async-along!

What is an Async-along? I made up this word from "asynchronous" and "singalong". "Asynchronous" means "not at the same time", and you all know what a singalong is. The idea is that we will all record our parts of the singalong separately and I will put them together. 

Here's how it works:

1. Practice singing "She'll be coming round the mountain" with this YouTube video.

2. When you are ready, call 423-251-5141, and leave a voicemail singing "She'll be coming round the mountain". The first verse is enough, but if you want, sing as much as you want! 

To make sure you sing at the right tempo, listen to the YouTube video as you sing your voicemail message. You can listen to the YouTube video with earbuds on a computer or iPad as you sing into your phone.


3. Feel free to whistle "She'll be coming round the mountain", clap to it, snap to it, beat a drum to it. If you can play an instrument, leave a voicemail of that too. Try to match the tempo from the YouTube video. You can also records some whoops and yells ("yee haw! woo hoo!"). Get some family and friends to leave voicemails too!


4. I will put all our voicemails together in a music editor to make our singalong. I have two recordings already and but we need more to make it sound like a real singalong. The more, the merrier!


5. Need help? I'll be in a Google Meet on Tuesday, September 14, to answer any questions.
