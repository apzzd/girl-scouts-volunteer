SWAPS

Hello, Scouts! Ready for the SWAPS challenge?

SWAPS stands for "Special Whatchamacallits Affectionately Pinned Somewhere." Girl Scouts make these small tokens of friendship to exchange with other Girl Scouts. We're going to each make a set to share with other scouts in our troop. Here is what to do:


1. Make 5 small pictures.

Attached is a strip of paper with 5 small circles. Draw a small picture in each one. You can use pencil, crayons, paint, collage. Just make sure the picture is flat. 

What kind of picture should you make? Let the picture represent you, your community, our troop, or any idea from the Girl Scout Law.


2. Send it to me.

Send your 5 drawings to me using the enclosed self-addressed, stamped envelope. That will get your SWAPS to my house where we will finish making them into pins.


Enclosed are a couple finished SWAPs. Will you pin them on your vest or sash?

If you need help with your SWAPS, join the Google Meet on Tuesday, September 14.

We'll show off our SWAPS during our Girl Scout Way workshop on Wednesday, October 27, 2021.
