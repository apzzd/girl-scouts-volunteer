Before workshop:

1. I make a packet with

	- self-addressed stamped envelope
	- instructions on "Leave a place better than you found it"

2. Girls do this before 10/31:
	- "leave a place better than you found it" and email a pic
	- make a swap and mail to me

Day of workshop:
1. Deliver these two girls:
	- swaps
	- badge
	- birthday snack


Music:
She'll be comin' round the mountain (https://youtu.be/g9eRTAK8qBE?t=8)

Each girl calls my phone and sings the song on voicemail. It's pretty easy if you sing into your phone while listening to the music with ear buds. I copy the audio to my laptop and add all girls' tracks together in Garage Band.
