Make 3 MP3 files. You can use https://audiomass.co or any phone or computer app you prefer.

Recording 1: Sing a short song or recite a short poem. This should be just your voice: no instruments and no background sounds.

Recording 2: Play an instrument. You can use a musical instrument; clap your hands; or use items from around your house.

Recording 3: Record an interesting noise or sound near your home, like birdsong, train horn, or people laughing. Any interesting sound from your environment will do.
