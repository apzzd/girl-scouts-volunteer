Leave a place better than you found it

Hi again, Scouts! Here is another challege to get ready for the Girl Scout Way workshop in October. Leave a place better than you found it!

You scouts are a helpful, kind-hearted bunch. I know you are already helping your family, neighbors, and community. So this challenge should be easy. Here is what to do:


1. Decide how to leave a place better than you found it.

You pick the place. Does your school lunch table need a clean-up? Do your parents need help folding all that laundry? Does a neighbor need help working in the yard? Does your baby brother or sister need a diaper change? Pitch in and help out. Please note: if you are thinking about picking up litter, get permission from a parent first.


2. Tell me about it.

Send a description of what you did to gs@dyer.me. Before and after photos or a drawing would be great too!


Need help? I'll be in a Google Meet on Tuesday, September 14, to answer any questions.

We'll celebrate your contributions during our Girl Scout Way workshop on Wednesday, October 27, 2021, and in our next newsletter.
