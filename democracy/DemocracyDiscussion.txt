Let's read the statement from our cit government about Child Friendly City.

UNICEF recommends asking kids if their city is a Child-friendly city. So...

Do you think kids feel safe in Johnson City?

Can they go to the doctor when they feel sick?

Do they like school?

Are there plenty of parks and playgrounds?

Do adults like parent, teachers and coaches listen to kids?

Could things in JC be made better for kids? How? What are some issues or problems for kids in our city?

How does a city government listen to its residents? How can you make your voice heard to Johnson City government?

If you have ideas, you are invited to contact the city yourself! Go to act.unicefusa.org/CFCIJC.

Recently we found out that there has been a 50% drop in reading proficiency in Tennessee third graders. Proficient means able to read according to level set by our state government; it's determined from your TCAP score. A 50% drop means that, of the third graders from last year, the number of proficient readers is cut in half this year. 

Research shows us 34% of Tennessee third graders are not proficient readers. That means one third-grade kid in every group of 3 kids cannot read at third-grade level.

Is this a problem? Why is it important for third-graders to be able to read at their grade level? 

Research also shows that students that were not reading at their grade level by third grader have a higher changes of dropping out of high school and higher chance of living in poverty (not having enough money).

How has this school year gone for kids? According to you, do you think kids were able to learn over the school year? Were they able to get better at reading?

Parents, teachers, and legislatures have been concerned that this past year has made learning difficult. A new bill in the TN assembly would like to make these changes. What is your opinion about each one? Are you in favor? Why or why not? 

1. Make a new academic summer camp this year

2. Make new mini camps and tutoring during the school year to help kids with reading a learning

3. Make a new program specifically for teaching young kids to read, and train teachers to to teach this way

4. Make third graders repeat third grader if they are not proficient at the end of the school year. They could move on to fourth grade if they go to summer school, go to tutoring in fourth grade, or retake and pass the reading exam.


Putting yourself in parents' shoes, what concerns or questions might parents have?
