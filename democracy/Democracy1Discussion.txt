UNICEF recommends asking kids if their city is a Child-friendly city. So...

Do you think kids feel safe in Johnson City?

Can they go to the doctor when they feel sick?

Do they like school?

Are there plenty of parks and playgrounds?

Do adults like parent, teachers and coaches listen to kids?

Could things in JC be made better for kids? How? What are some issues or problems for kids in our city?

How does a city government listen to its residents? How can you make your voice heard to Johnson City government?

If you have ideas, you are invited to contact the city yourself! Go to act.unicefusa.org/CFCIJC.
